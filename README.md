# SubscriptionContract

## Introduction

This is an experimental project aiming to create a way to provide a subscription solution using smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

This project is written in Solidity, using Truffle.

## How it works

Basically users are able to subscribe to the contract for a specific period, using an already defined token. Later, they will be able to pay to continue the subscription or pause it.



This is an on-going project, the current features are:
- [x] Subscribe to the contract (using a specific token)
- [x] Pay for a subscription
- [x] Pause the subscription

Future features will be:
- [ ] Multi-tokens support
